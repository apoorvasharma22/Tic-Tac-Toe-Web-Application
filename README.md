# Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-Application
This is a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a clean and responsive interface where two players can take turns to play the classic game directly in the browser. The game logic is handled entirely with JavaScript, providing real-time feedback and detecting win, lose, or draw scenarios. With a focus on both functionality and design, this project is a great example of combining front-end technologies to build an interactive web experience. Ideal for beginners looking to understand DOM manipulation and event handling, this project can also serve as a foundation for more advanced game features.
